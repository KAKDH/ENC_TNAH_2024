# Modelling humanities data with TEI-XML: Scholarly editing and manuscript cataloguing in the digital age

This course teaches students how to encode and model humanities data using TEI-XML, with a focus
on creating digital scholarly editions and cataloguing manuscripts. Students will learn
to model complex textual structures and metadata, enabling the digital analysis of gathered materials.
Through practical exercises, participants will learn to apply the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
guidelines to their own projects, as well as how to customise and document their encoding to fit their
research questions. By the end of the course, students will be able to produce customised digital
editions of texts and catalogue entries for manuscripts.
